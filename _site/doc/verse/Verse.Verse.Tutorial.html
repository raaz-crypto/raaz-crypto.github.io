Implementing cryptographic primitives in a High level language is
problematic for two reasons.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> The resulting code is not fast (enough), but more importantly

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> The safety of the resulting program can be compromised due to side
  channel leaks.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

Due to this unfortunate situation, cryptographic libraries, even for a
high level language like Haskell, has in it a lots of hand written C
and assembly code fragment. This is not a nice situation to be in.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

As a solution to this problem, we propose Verse, an embedded domain
specific language specifically designed for writing cryptographic
primitives. This module serves as a short tutorial for Verse.

Our aim is to make Verse's surface syntax clean enough so that

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> Cryptographic implementations written in Verse should be readable
  even to a user who does not know Coq. Cryptographic libraries
  require a great deal of expert review. It should be possible for a
  cryptographic experts who might not know much of Coq to follow the
  intricacies of the code. To this end, we have made the surface
  syntax of Verse mimic the syntax of a typical imperative language
  with symbolic variables, assignment statements and array indexing.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Cryptographic implementations should be writable by a programmer
  with a working knowledge of Coq, without worrying about the
  internals of Coq. The verse language is designed to be correct by
  construction which throws up a lot of proof obligations. We have
  automatic tactics to dispose these of.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


<div class="paragraph"> </div>

Therefore, we believe that you can get started with verse with almost
no knowledge of coq or verse. If you want to hack on verse code, you
will need coq (currently tested with 8.6 and 8.7) and the coq library
CoLoR.  The suggested means of developing verse code is using
opam. However, the CoLoR library has issues with the opam-2. So we
recommend using opam-1.2.2. We also recommend the use of emacs and the
proof general mode for editing.

Verse is really a low level language with an instruction set that can
be directly translated (almost 1:1) to the instruction set of a
typical general purpose machine architecture like x86. So one can
really program pretty close to the machine including controlling
aspects like register allocation. This is very important because we
would like to exactly predict the emitted code so that we can control
side channel leakages. However, verse exploits the fact that it is
embedded in Coq to give the programmer a markedly high level
experience.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> Verse is equipped with a type system that is rich enough to even
  prevent errors in array indexing and endian conversion.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> One can generate Verse code using functions written in Gallina which
  behave like macros for code generation

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Many of the type safety property in verse is achieved by making the
  verse language correct by construction. However, this does not
  become proof burden to the user thanks to Ltac.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Finally, the interactive mode like proof general, gives an IDE like
  experience when building complicated programs.
